Place Lottie JSON animation files here to make them available to the frontend at `/static/lottie/<filename>.json`.

Recommended sources (search for "open source" or filter by license on LottieFiles):
- https://lottiefiles.com/

Notes:
- Choose friendly, kid-appropriate monster/character animations (ages 8–13).
- After adding files, the frontend will list them at `GET /api/games/lottie` and they will be served under `/static/lottie/`.
