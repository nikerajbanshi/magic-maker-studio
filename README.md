# Magic Maker Studio – Creative Learning Sandbox

## 📅 Week 1 – Problem Understanding & Project Setup

### Objective
Establish a clear learning problem, understand target learners, and set up the project workspace for effective collaboration and rapid prototyping during the 6-week bootcamp and hackathon.

---

### Key Activities
- Studied foundational concepts of instructional design and digital educational content
- Analyzed existing educational platforms to identify gaps in child-friendly creative learning tools
- Defined the core learning problem and target learner group
- Set up GitHub for version control and Notion for planning and task tracking

---

### Problem Definition
Children often engage with digital content passively and lack safe, age-appropriate platforms that encourage creative expression and literacy development. Many existing creative tools are either too complex or lack proper moderation for younger learners.

**Proposed Solution:**  
**Magic Maker Studio** — a guided creative learning sandbox where children create stories, poems, and characters through structured, quiz-style choices, supported by AI-assisted reading and writing feedback, and shared safely via a moderated Magic Library.

---

### Target Learners
- Children aged **8–13**
- Early to developing literacy levels
- Learners who benefit from guided interaction rather than open-ended tools

---

### Initial Feature Scope
- Guided story and poem creation (quiz-based flow)
- AI-assisted grammar and vocabulary feedback (prototype level)
- Magic Library for sharing creations with moderation
- Simple, accessible, child-friendly UI

---

### Deliverables Completed
- ✅ Project idea finalized and documented  
- ✅ GitHub repository initialized with basic structure  
- ✅ Notion workspace created for planning and progress tracking  
- ✅ Learning problem and learner needs clearly defined  

---

### Outcome
By the end of Week 1, the project is grounded in a well-defined learning problem, aligned with learner needs, and supported by an organized workflow ready for rapid prototyping in the following weeks.

---

### Next Focus (Week 2)
- Define user journeys and interaction flows  
- Finalize prototype feature prioritization  
- Begin low-fidelity UI and system design
