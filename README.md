# Magic Maker Studio  
**Creative Learning Sandbox**

Magic Maker Studio is a creative learning sandbox designed to support interactive, child-friendly educational experiences. The platform emphasizes guided creativity, literacy development, and safe content sharing within a structured digital environment.

This repository establishes a **scalable full-stack foundation** using a decoupled architecture, prioritizing clean project organization, collaborative workflows, and future extensibility.

## Project Context

This repository represents the **Week 2** of a 6-week bootcamp and hackathon.

**Primary focus this week:**
- Git & GitHub project management
- Python backend development
- API fundamentals
- Frontend scaffolding
- Clear documentation and structure

Feature completeness is intentionally deferred in favor of architectural clarity and long-term feasibility.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend:** Python 3.13, FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** React with Vite  
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with automatic OpenAPI documentation  
- **Workflow:** Feature-based branching with incremental commits  

The backend and frontend are fully decoupled to support independent development and future scaling.
